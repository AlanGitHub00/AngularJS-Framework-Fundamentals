#User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to search for Git repos so that I can find the repos that I am looking for.

##Acceptance Criteria

- List of repos does not initially load
- A search text box is added and the contents of the text box is sent to the server to filter search results
- A "Load Repos" button is added to trigger the search
- When no results are returned, a simple alert is displayed to the user
