#User Stories

As a user, I want the system to notify me when a topping has been added to the pizza so that I can know it functioned correctly and I can then search for additional toppings.

As a user, I want the system to notify me when my search yields zero results so that I can modify my search criteria.

##Acceptance Criteria

- Initially, no messages are displayed to the user
- Once a topping has been added, display a message to the user with the text "Topping added." along with a button labeled "close"
- The "close" button should hide the "Topping added." message
- If search criteria yields zero results, display a message with the text "No results." to the user
- Once the user starts searching for toppings, hide both the "Topping added." and "No results." messages
